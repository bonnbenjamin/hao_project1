# hao_project1
I took away the solutions file for now.If this is too hard I will make a easier one. But it is important to have a problem with no solution to look at and find a way to do it.

OS MODULE -----------


need to look up the "os" module

it is a core module that comes with python. It helps you access system files and do system tasks. 

it can help you go through filenames in folders. 


TRY EXCEPT ----------

This is a very important concept. It allows for your code to run even if there is an error and for your code to be able to do something else upon an error being called. 


LOGGING -------------


Logging is very important. it lets you track errors especially for long running processes or processes that have a lot of outputs. 
Learn how to initialize the logging module. 


LEVEL 1 : 

I have a folder with a bunch of files in it. 

Each file has one word. 

Iterate through the folder list and open each file and read the word. Grab all the word from the list and write it to your own file called hao.txt. 


You need to learn the join() method, the endswith() method, how to read and write to a file. Also i threw in an error for you to try to go around. 



LEVEL 2 : 


There are many ways to go around the error i threw for level 1 but for level 2 i want you to try to use a try and except block to go around it. 



LEVEL 3:

I want you to use the logging module so that everytime you hit an error in your except block that you log it to a file named, project1.log.


Look up the logging module how to set it up. What levels of message there are (info,error,warning).
